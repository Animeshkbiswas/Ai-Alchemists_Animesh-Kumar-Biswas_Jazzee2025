## 🧠 Problem Statement

Rural and resource-limited areas lack access to trained radiologists. Diseases like tuberculosis and lung cancer often go undetected until too late. Our solution leverages GenAI to provide instant, interpretable chest X-ray analysis.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔬 **Disease Detection (ViT Model)** – Trained on NIH, CheXpert, and Montgomery datasets.
- 🧾 **AI-Generated Report** – Uses OpenAI GPT to create clinician-friendly, interpretable summaries.
- 🌐 **Web Interface** – Built in React for image upload, prediction, and explanation.
- 📊 **Confidence Score Visualization** – Helps doctors trust and verify AI output.
- 🧠 **Explainability** – Grad-CAM visual heatmaps for transparency.
